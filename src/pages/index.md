    Taylored Audio is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn
    about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take
    coffee production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass
    that knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
